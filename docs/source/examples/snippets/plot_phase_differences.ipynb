    "The standard way to represent event-based data is linearly; we plot the events with time on the x-axis. When we compare two sequences, say the stimuli and the responses from a `finger-tapping experiment <https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03206433>`_, often we take the absolute value for :math:`\\Delta t` so we can for instance take averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, consider a stimulus sequence with inter-onset intervals (IOIs) ``[500, 480, 510, 470]`` and a response sequence with IOIs ``[498, 482, 504, 476]``. The element-wise differences between stimulus and response are then: ``[-2, 2, -6, 6]``.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the participant's total error we cannot simply take the sum or the average, because the positive and negative values will cancel out, and we end up with a score of 0, even though the participant was not perfect in their response.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate this, people often only look at the absolute values, which would mean a total error score of 16 in the example. However, that does not indicate whether the participant on average was too early with their response, or too late.\n",
    "\n",
    "In response to this problem, over the years people have started using methods from circular statistics to capture all that lost data. Below are two examples, one in which we compare some random data to an isochronous sequence, and one in which we compare some actual stimulus and response finger-tapping data. In both cases we plot a circular histogram."
