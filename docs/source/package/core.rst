Most important classes
======================

There are three classes that make up the core of this package:

* The :py:class:`Sequence<combio.core.Sequence>` class, which only contains **timing** information.
* The :py:class:`Stimulus<combio.core.Sequence>` class, which only contains a **sound**.
* The :py:class:`StimSequence<combio.core.Sequence>` class, which contains **both timing information and sounds**.
