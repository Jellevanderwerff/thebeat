========================
*thebeat*'s core classes
========================

There are three classes that make up the core of this package:

* The :py:class:`Sequence<thebeat.core.Sequence>` class, which only contains **timing** information.
* The :py:class:`SoundStimulus<thebeat.core.SoundStimulus>` class, which only contains a **sound**.
* The :py:class:`SoundSequence<thebeat.core.SoundSequence>` class, which contains **both timing information and sounds**.

In addition, there is the :py:class:`BaseSequence<thebeat.core.BaseSequence>` class,
which is the parent class of the :py:class:`Sequence<thebeat.core.Sequence>`, :py:class:`Rhythm<thebeat.music.Rhythm>`,
and :py:class:`SoundSequence<thebeat.core.SoundSequence>` classes.
In principle it is irrelevant, except for understanding the internal workings of this package.
